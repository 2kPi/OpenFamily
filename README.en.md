## 🚀 Quick Start

### ⚡ Automatic Installation with Docker

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NexaFlowFrance/OpenFamily/main/scripts/install-docker.sh | bash
```

This script will:
- Install Docker and Docker Compose (if needed)
- Clone the OpenFamily repository
- Configure PostgreSQL
- Start the application on port 3000

---

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Linux Server** (Ubuntu 20.04+ recommended) or Windows with WSL
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (automatically installed by the script)
- **2 GB RAM minimum**
- **10 GB disk space**

### Manual Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/NexaFlowFrance/OpenFamily.git
cd OpenFamily

# 2. Create the .env file
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Modify PostgreSQL password in .env
nano .env  # Change DB_PASSWORD

# 4. Launch with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# 5. Access the application
# http://localhost:3000 (local)
# http://your-ip:3000 (local network)
# https://your-domain.com (with reverse proxy)
```

### Network Configuration

#### Local access only
The application works immediately on `http://localhost:3000`

#### Local network access (LAN)
1. Find your server's IP: `ip addr show` or `ipconfig`
2. Access from any device: `http://192.168.X.X:3000`
3. **Automatic detection**: The app detects it's hosted and enables server mode

#### Internet access (optional)
See the [Deployment Guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for:
- Configuring a domain name
- Installing an SSL certificate (HTTPS)
- Securing access with authentication

### For Developers

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start PostgreSQL locally
docker-compose up -d postgres

# Run in development mode
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Start production server
pnpm start
```

**Note**: Development mode (`pnpm dev`) requires PostgreSQL. Use Docker Compose to start only the database.

### For Users

#### Option 1: PWA (Recommended)
1. Access your OpenFamily instance (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:3000`)
2. On mobile: click "Add to Home Screen"
3. On desktop: click the install icon in the address bar
4. The app will install like a native app

#### Option 2: Native Mobile Applications
- **Android**: Install the APK available in releases
- **iOS**: Use TestFlight or compile from source code

#### Option 3: Web Browser
Simply access your OpenFamily server URL from any modern browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge).

## 💾 Data Storage

OpenFamily uses a **centralized server architecture with PostgreSQL**:

### 🗄️ Architecture

- **Database**: PostgreSQL (included in Docker Compose)
- **API Server**: Express.js (Node.js)
- **Synchronization**: Real-time via REST API
- **Security**: Authentication token, family isolation

### 📊 Stored Data

All data is stored in PostgreSQL:
- `shopping_items` - Shopping list
- `tasks` - Tasks and schedule
- `appointments` - Appointments
- `family_members` - Family members (with health info)
- `recipes` - Recipes
- `meals` - Meal planning
- `budgets` - Monthly budgets
- `families` - Family configuration

### 🔄 Automatic Synchronization

- ✅ **Multi-device**: Access from PC, tablet, smartphone
- ✅ **Real-time**: Changes are instant
- ✅ **Automatic detection**: The app detects the server on the network
- ✅ **Default family**: Automatic initial configuration

### 💾 Backup

PostgreSQL data is persisted via Docker volumes:

```bash
# Manual backup
docker exec openfamily-db pg_dump -U openfamily openfamily > backup.sql

# Restore from backup
docker exec -i openfamily-db psql -U openfamily openfamily < backup.sql
```

**Recommendation**: Configure daily automatic backups with cron or a PostgreSQL backup tool.

## ❓ FAQ

### Are my data secure?
Yes, your data is stored on your own server. You have full control and responsibility for security. We recommend:
- Using strong PostgreSQL passwords
- Enabling HTTPS with SSL certificates
- Keeping your server updated
- Configuring regular backups

### Can I use the application offline?
A connection to the server is required to synchronize data. Once data is loaded, the PWA can cache content for brief offline periods, but changes won't sync until connection is restored.

### How do I backup my data?
Configure automatic backups of your PostgreSQL database:
```bash
# Manual backup
docker exec openfamily-db pg_dump -U openfamily openfamily > backup.sql

# Automatic backup with cron (daily at 2am)
0 2 * * * docker exec openfamily-db pg_dump -U openfamily openfamily > /backups/openfamily-$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).sql
```
See [DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for more details.

### Is the application available in multiple languages?
Yes! The interface is available in **French 🇫🇷**, **English 🇬🇧**, **German 🇩🇪**, and **Spanish 🇪🇸**. You can change the language in Settings.

### Does the application work on iOS?
Yes, you can install it as a PWA from Safari. Access your OpenFamily server URL and add it to your home screen. On Android, you can also install the APK.

### Can I synchronize between multiple devices?
Yes! That's the main advantage of the server architecture. All family members can access the same data from their own devices (PC, tablet, smartphone). Changes sync instantly.

### Is the application really free?
Yes, 100% free and open source. No hidden fees, no subscription. You only need to host it on your own server (or use a free tier on cloud providers).
